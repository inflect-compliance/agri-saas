/**
 * Audit Coherence S10 (deferral lock, 2026-05-27) — Gap 10
 * (field-level RBAC + ABAC) is deferred BY DESIGN per the existing
 * rationale doc at
 * `docs/implementation-notes/2026-05-24-audit-s10-tenant-isolation.md`.
 *
 * This ratchet does NOT lock the absence of field-level RBAC —
 * a future epic SHOULD implement it. Instead, it locks the
 * INFRASTRUCTURE that the deferral assumes is in place:
 *
 *   1. The rationale doc exists at the canonical path.
 *   2. The doc explicitly names "field-level RBAC stays deferred"
 *      AND "ABAC deferred" as decisions, with reasoning, so a future
 *      refactor that re-opens the question lands a paper trail
 *      rather than starting from scratch.
 *   3. RLS — the existing strong-isolation primitive — is still
 *      the active mechanism (the rationale rests on RLS being
 *      load-bearing at the DB layer).
 *
 * If a future epic ships field-level RBAC + supersedes the
 * deferral, replace this ratchet with one locking the new
 * mechanism. The deferral doc + this lock are the audit-trail
 * baseline.
