/**
 * Roadmap-6 PR-3 — focus-ring offset discipline.
 *
 * Tab through the product. Watch the focus ring change shape:
 * `ring-offset-1` here, `ring-offset-2` there. The keyboard user
 * registers the difference between 1px and 2px offset; for a
 * great product, that difference must be intentional.
 *
 * The audit found 6 `ring-offset-1` sites. Three were drift
 * (TreeViewItem rows, selection-toolbar buttons, table click
 * targets — all "normal-sized" elements where the canonical 2px
 * offset reads cleaner). Three were deliberately small-element
 * focus rings (TextLink within a text run, RiskMatrix cell focus
 * + selected state — the cell is tiny, 1px offset prevents the
 * ring from engulfing the cell).
 *
 * What lands
 *
 *   • TreeViewItem, selection-toolbar, table → migrate to
 *     `ring-offset-2`. Three drift sites resolved.
 *   • TextLink (typography), RiskMatrixCell focus, RiskMatrixCell
 *     selected → ALLOWLISTED with written reason.
 *   • The two ring-offset COLOR tokens (`ring-offset-background`
 *     for page-level, `ring-offset-bg-default` for card-internal)
 *     are NOT interchangeable and remain distinct. Both encode
 *     legitimate offset surfaces.
 *
 * What this ratchet locks
 *
 *   No `.tsx` file under `src/` may use `ring-offset-1` (or
 *   smaller / non-canonical sizes) outside the documented small-
 *   element allowlist. The canonical offset is `ring-offset-2`.
 *
 * What this ratchet does NOT police
 *
 *   - The choice between `ring-offset-background` (page-level)
 *     and `ring-offset-bg-default` (card-internal). Both are
 *     correct in their contexts.
 *   - `focus-visible:ring-2` width (the ring itself, not its
 *     offset) — that's part of a separate state-language
 *     discipline.
