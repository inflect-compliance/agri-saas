/**
 * R17-PR8 — Risk Distribution donut filter-awareness (REMOVED).
 *
 * PR-8 originally made the Risk Distribution donut the first
 * chart-filter consumer: the card reacted to the selected KPI with a
 * focus ring / dim. The Risk Distribution donut has since been removed
 * from the dashboard entirely (along with the Evidence Status, Compliance
 * Alerts, and Evidence Expiry widgets).
 *
 * This file is now a forward-guard: it locks in the removal so a future
 * change that re-introduces the donut is a conscious decision. The generic
 * `ChartFocusWrapper` recipe that PR-8 seeded lives on and is covered by
 * `r17-pr9-charts-filter-aware.test.ts`.
