/**
 * Roadmap-7 PR-3 — single H1 per page.
 *
 * A page should have ONE top-level heading. Two `<Heading level={1}>`
 * occurrences in the same source file mean either:
 *
 *   (a) the loaded branch and the loading early-return branch each
 *       render the same H1 — at runtime only one renders, but the
 *       source duplication is a maintenance hazard. Demote the
 *       loading branch's heading to level={2} with explicit
 *       "Loading X…" copy and the H1 is single-source.
 *
 *   (b) the file legitimately renders different page identities at
 *       different states — invite pages flip between "Invitation"
 *       and "Invitation expired"; auth/mfa flips between "MFA
 *       Enrollment Required" and "Verify Your Identity". These are
 *       distinct pages that share a route, and each state's H1 is
 *       its own page. They're listed in EXEMPT_FILES with reason.
 *
 * Pairs with the broader Roadmap-4 PR-8 Heading-level discipline
 * (H1 = page · H2 = section · H3 = subsection). This ratchet is the
 * complementary "no two H1s in one file" check the count-based
 * primitive ratchet doesn't cover.
