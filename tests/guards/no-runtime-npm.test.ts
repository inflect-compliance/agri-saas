/**
 * The runtime image ships no npm — and nothing at runtime may assume it.
 *
 * Trivy blocks the build on CRITICAL/HIGH findings, and the ones it kept
 * flagging did not belong to us: they lived in the npm CLI bundled inside
 * `node:22-alpine` at `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm` (a CRITICAL tar
 * gzip-bomb DoS, CVE-2026-59873, plus HIGH brace-expansion / js-yaml). They are
 * unreachable from application code and unfixable from our package-lock,
 * because they are the base image's dependencies, not ours.
 *
 * The fix was to delete the CLI rather than suppress the finding: nothing in
 * the runtime needs it once the entrypoint calls the VENDORED
 * `./node_modules/.bin/prisma` (`prisma` is a production dependency, so it is
 * already in the image — the old `npx --yes prisma@7.8.0` was re-downloading a
 * package that was sitting on disk).
 *
 * This guard locks both halves in. The failure mode it prevents is silent and
 * only shows up in production: a re-introduced `npx` in a startup path runs
 * fine in dev and in CI — where npm exists — and then dies at container start
 * with "npx: not found".
