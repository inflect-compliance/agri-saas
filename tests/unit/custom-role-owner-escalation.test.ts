/**
 * Custom roles cannot grant OWNER-only permissions.
 *
 * The hole this closes was real and reachable. `parsePermissionsJson` seeded
 * from the base role's defaults and then let ANY stored boolean win, with no
 * ceiling:
 *
 *   1. an ADMIN holds `admin.manage`, which gates custom-role CRUD;
 *   2. `validatePermissionsJson` checked shape only — never values;
 *   3. so they could store `{ admin: { tenant_lifecycle: true } }` against
 *      baseRole ADMIN, assign the role to themselves (no self-assignment
 *      guard, no "cannot grant what you don't hold" check), and
 *   4. `requirePermission('admin.tenant_lifecycle')` reads
 *      `ctx.appPermissions` — the very set `parsePermissionsJson` produced.
 *
 * That yields tenant deletion, DEK rotation and OWNER management: the whole
 * OWNER/ADMIN boundary from Epic 1. The custom-role EDITOR could not do it, but
 * every ADMIN could, via the API alone.
 *
 * The UI was not the control. `roles/page.tsx` kept a hand-copied permission
 * schema that had silently drifted — missing exactly these two keys since they
 * were added three months after it was written — so the checkboxes never
 * rendered. That accident was the only thing making the escalation curl-only.
 *
 * Both halves are tested here because either alone leaves a gap: write-time
 * rejection does nothing for blobs already in the database, and read-time
 * forcing alone would let the DB hold a lie.

 * roles editor was: `SCOPE_ACTION_MAP.admin` happens to list only
 * `manage/members/sso/scim`, and the `*` shortcut happens to return ADMIN's set
 * (where both keys are false).
 *
 * Both are hand-maintained lists. Adding `tenant_lifecycle` to the admin write
 * scope — or pointing the wildcard at OWNER — would hand an API key the
 * OWNER-only capabilities with nothing to stop it. These tests make that a CI
