# deploy/check-drift.sh — detect drift between the repo-canonical compose and
# the live prod VM.
#
# The repo is the source of truth for the prod Compose STRUCTURE. This script
# compares the sha256 of deploy/docker-compose.vm.yml against the live file on
# the VM and exits non-zero on any mismatch, with a readable hint. Run it on a
# WEEKLY cadence (cron / a scheduled Actions job once a GCP service-account
# secret exists) so silent hand-edits on the VM surface fast.
#
# Watchtower auto-updates only the app + worker IMAGES; it never rewrites the
# compose file, so a drift here always means a human edited the VM out of band
# (or forgot to run deploy/apply.sh after a repo change).
#
# Usage:  deploy/check-drift.sh
# Exit:   0 = in sync, 1 = drift detected, 2 = could not reach the VM.
