// ─── Hub-and-spoke organization permissions (Epic O-2) ────────────────────
//
// Org-level permissions are deliberately KEPT SEPARATE from the tenant-
// level `PermissionSet` rather than nested inside it. The two govern
// different domains: tenant `PermissionSet` controls per-tenant
// resource access (controls, evidence, risks, etc.); `OrgPermissionSet`
// controls portfolio-level access (the org dashboard, tenant lifecycle
// under the org, org member management).
//
// They never mix: a request resolves EITHER `RequestContext` (tenant
// scope, via `getTenantCtx`) OR `OrgContext` (org scope, via
// `getOrgCtx`) — never both at the same time. The drill-down from
// portfolio → tenant detail re-resolves as `RequestContext` against
// the auto-provisioned AUDITOR membership, where the existing
// per-tenant permissions take over.

/**
 * Portfolio-level permissions for a hub-and-spoke organization.
 *
 *   - canViewPortfolio  — see the org dashboard summary cards
 *                         (snapshot aggregates across child tenants).
 *   - canDrillDown      — open per-tenant detail rows from the
 *                         portfolio. ORG_ADMIN only — relies on the
 *                         auto-provisioned AUDITOR `TenantMembership`
 *                         in every child tenant; ORG_READER doesn't
 *                         get that auto-provisioning, so even if the
 *                         UI hint were `true` they'd 403 at the
 *                         tenant RLS layer.
 *   - canExportReports  — CSV/PDF export of portfolio summary +
 *                         non-performing items. Available to both
 *                         org roles; the export only contains data
 *                         the role can see (snapshot data for both;
 *                         drill-down content for ORG_ADMIN only).
 *   - canManageTenants  — create new tenants under the org, link
 *                         existing tenants. ORG_ADMIN only.
 *   - canManageMembers  — add / remove / role-change org members.
 *                         ORG_ADMIN only.
 *   - canConfigureDashboard — add / update / delete the widgets that
 *                         compose the org-level dashboard. ORG_ADMIN
 *                         only. Read access to the rendered dashboard
 *                         is gated by `canViewPortfolio`; this flag
 *                         only controls the configuration layer
