/**
 * Sentry error reporting — BROWSER integration.
 *
 * The server SDK (`sentry.ts`) is initialised in `instrumentation.ts` on the
 * Node runtime, but nothing ever initialised Sentry on the CLIENT — so
 * `global-error.tsx`'s `captureException`, chunk-load failures, and client JS
 * crashes on rural devices were invisible (the only surviving client signal
 * was the anonymous web-vitals beacon). This is the missing client channel.
 *
 * Gated on `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`: absent ⇒ a NO-OP (a self-hosted deploy
 * stays clean), mirroring how VAPID gates web push. Deliberately conservative
 * for mobile / metered rural connections:
 *   - errors ALWAYS captured (`sampleRate: 1`) — the whole point,
 *   - traces sampled LOW (default 2%) — perf spans are nice-to-have,
 *   - NO session replay (`replays*SampleRate: 0`) — replay is a heavy,
 *     data-hungry channel we deliberately don't ship to field devices.
 * Releases are tagged so a field crash maps to the deploy that shipped it.
 *
 * Boundaries: OTel + the web-vitals beacon already own tracing and vitals;
 * this adds ONLY the client error channel, not a second copy of those.
