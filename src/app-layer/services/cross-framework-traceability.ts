/**
 * Cross-Framework Traceability & Gap Analysis Service
 *
 * Applies conservative business semantics on top of the raw mapping
 * resolution engine to answer product-level questions:
 *
 * 1. TRACEABILITY — "If I'm compliant with requirement X in framework A,
 *                   what does that imply for framework B?"
 *
 * 2. GAP ANALYSIS — "Given my compliance posture in framework A,
 *                   which requirements in framework B still need attention?"
 *
 * Key design principle: Mappings support traceability and partial reasoning,
 * NOT automatic compliance. This service carefully distinguishes between:
 *   - Strong traceability (EQUAL)       → requirement fully satisfied
 *   - Partial coverage (SUPERSET)       → target likely satisfied, verify scope
 *   - Partial coverage (SUBSET)         → gap remains, source doesn't fully cover target
 *   - Overlap (INTERSECT)               → shared ground, explicit review needed
 *   - Informational (RELATED)           → awareness only, no coverage claim
 *
 * This service does NOT interact with the database directly. It consumes
 * the MappingTraceResult from the resolution engine and applies business
 * interpretation logic. DB-backed usecases wrap this service.
