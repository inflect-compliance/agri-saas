/**
 * Editable Lifecycle Service — Pure-logic state machine for draft/publish lifecycle.
 *
 * Provides the core lifecycle operations that any domain entity can use:
 * - Create initial draft state
 * - Update draft payload
 * - Publish (promote draft → published, snapshot prior version to history)
 * - Revert draft to a prior published version
 * - Archive (freeze entity, preserve history)
 *
 * Design:
 * ───────
 * All functions are **pure** — they take an EditableState, return a new
 * EditableState. No side effects, no database calls, no I/O.
 *
 * This service does NOT know about Prisma, tenants, or specific domain
 * entities. Domain-specific usecases (policy.ts, control.ts, etc.) are
 * responsible for:
 * 1. Loading EditableState from their Prisma model
 * 2. Calling lifecycle functions
 * 3. Persisting the updated EditableState back
 *
 * This mirrors the design of `version-history.ts` (pure history tracking)
 * and `mapping-resolution.ts` (pure graph traversal with pluggable loader).
 *
 * Invariants:
 * ───────────
 * - Version starts at 1 (matching CISO-Assistant editing_version convention)
 * - Version increments ONLY on publish (never on draft edits)
 * - History is append-only (snapshots are never mutated or removed)
 * - First publish (v1→v2) does NOT create a history entry (no prior state)
 * - Second publish (v2→v3) snapshots v2 to history, etc.
 * - Cannot publish without a draft
 * - Cannot publish or edit when ARCHIVED
 * - Revert loads a snapshot INTO the draft (does NOT change published)
 *
