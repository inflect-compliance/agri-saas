/**
 * Vision subsystem — a leaf/crop PHOTO → likely pest/disease + a short
 * recommendation. SERVER-ONLY: every provider here loads a heavy native
 * dependency (`onnxruntime-node`, `sharp`) or the Anthropic SDK, none of
 * which may ever enter a client bundle. The UI card imports ONLY the
 * persisted result TYPE (`PestIdentification`), never a provider.
 *
 * Two backends sit behind one `VisionProvider` interface:
 *   - `onnx`   — on-device / edge classifier (CropNet / MobileNetV2-
 *                PlantVillage) via `onnxruntime-node`. Zero network, runs
 *                where the model file is present.
 *   - `claude` — Anthropic Messages-API vision fallback, used when the
 *                on-device model is absent OR its confidence is below the
 *                fallback threshold.
 *
 * AI here is a TRIAGE aid, NOT a diagnosis. The job that consumes a
 * `PestIdentification` always pairs it with a hard "verify with an
 * agronomist" disclaimer and gates low-confidence results — see
 * `app-layer/jobs/classify-photo.ts`.
