/**
 * Framework-agnostic optimistic UI helper.
 *
 * Wraps a "committed" value (typically from a fetcher — SWR, React
 * Query, a server component prop, or plain `useState`) with a local
 * optimistic overlay that reflects a pending mutation. On mutation
 * failure the overlay rolls back; on success the overlay stays until
 * the caller's `value` prop changes (their data source has re-synced),
 * at which point the overlay clears and the display returns to the
 * source of truth.
 *
 * This hook intentionally does NOT know about any data-fetching
 * library. It doesn't fetch, it doesn't revalidate, it doesn't wrap
 * toasts. The caller drives the mutation inside `commit` and is
 * responsible for refetching (or otherwise producing a fresh `value`)
 * before or during the commit. That keeps this hook usable from SWR,
 * React Query, RSC revalidation, or hand-rolled `fetch` code without
 * duplicating dependencies.
 *

 * ```
 *
 * ## Why overlay-until-value-changes instead of overlay-until-success
 *
 * When a commit resolves, the server's authoritative value hasn't
 * always propagated back to our `value` prop yet — the caller may
 * invalidate a fetch inside `commit` and the refetch may land on the
 * next tick. Clearing the overlay the instant `commit` resolves would
 * briefly show the old value (UI flicker). Clearing when `value`'s
 * reference changes hides that seam — the caller refetches, produces a
 * new reference, the effect fires, the overlay drops in one render.
 *
 * For callers that DON'T refresh their data source after `commit`, the
 * overlay stays visible for the session. That's a bug in the caller,
 * but it's a visibly-correct one: the user sees the value they just
 * set, which is what they expect.
 *
 * ## Sequential / concurrent updates
 *
 * If two `update` calls are in flight at once, the second overlay wins
 * (last-write-wins) and `isPending` stays true until all commits
 * resolve. If the first commit fails AFTER the second succeeds, the
 * overlay rolls back to the `value` prop — which is probably not what
 * you want. Callers that care about this should disable the control
 * while `isPending` is true.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const { data: risk, refetch } = useRisk(id);
 * const { value, isPending, update } = useOptimisticUpdate(risk);
 *
 * async function markRemediated() {
 *   await update({ ...value, status: 'remediated' }, async () => {
 *     await fetch(`/api/risks/${id}`, { method: 'PATCH', body: ... });
 *     await refetch(); // produces a new `risk` reference → overlay clears
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
